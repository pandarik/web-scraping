Mars Web Scraping and Data Analysis Project

# Overview
Welcome to the Mars Web Scraping and Data Analysis project! In this project, we’ll explore the fascinating world of Mars by scraping data from various sources and analyzing it. Our goal is to extract valuable insights and communicate them effectively.

# Background
As we’ve learned how to identify HTML elements, extract information using automated browsing with Splinter, and parse HTML with Beautiful Soup. These skills will be crucial as we explore Mars-related data.

# Project Details
Our project consists of two main deliverables:

# Deliverable 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News
We’ll visit the Mars news site, identify relevant elements, and extract titles and preview text from news articles.
The scraped data will be stored in Python dictionaries and a list.
Optionally, export the data to a JSON file.

Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News
Open the Jupyter Notebook part_1_mars_news.ipynb.
Use automated browsing to visit the Mars news site.
Create a Beautiful Soup object and extract relevant text elements.
Store the data in Python dictionaries and a list.
Optionally, export the data to a JSON file.

# Deliverable 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data
We’ll visit the Mars Temperature Data Site and extract temperature and atmospheric pressure data.
The data will be organized into a Pandas DataFrame.
We’ll clean, visualize, and analyze the data.

#Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data
Open the Jupyter Notebook part_2_mars_weather.ipynb.
Visit the Mars Temperature Data Site.
Use Beautiful Soup to extract data from the HTML table.
Create a Pandas DataFrame with appropriate column headings.
Analyze the data to answer specific questions (e.g., lowest/highest temperatures, atmospheric pressure).
Export the DataFrame to a CSV file.
# Data Analysis
We’ll explore the following questions:
How many months exist on Mars?
How many Martian days’ worth of data do we have?
Which months have the lowest and highest temperatures?
Which months have the lowest and highest atmospheric pressure?
How many terrestrial days exist in a Martian year?
